## Claim

Treating evidence as append-only (immutable once captured) enables reliable auditing and verification of knowledge assets.

## Evidence

Per EVI-20251222-0001: The observation notes that append-only logs and immutable audit trails are related concepts to evidence-first documentation. When evidence cannot be silently modified, any claim can be traced back to its original source and verified.

## Transferable Rule

**Make evidence immutable.** Once captured, evidence should not be modified — only annotated or superseded. This creates a verifiable chain of custody for all knowledge claims.
