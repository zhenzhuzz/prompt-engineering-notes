## Claim

Starting with evidence before making claims prevents "claim drift" — the gradual detachment of documentation from reality.

## Evidence

Per EVI-20251222-0001: The evidence-first approach inverts the typical workflow. Traditional documentation often starts with claims and then finds supporting evidence, which can lead to confirmation bias. By capturing evidence first and deriving claims from it, documentation stays grounded in observed reality.

## Transferable Rule

**Anchor claims to evidence.** When building any documentation or knowledge system, establish the evidence trail first. Claims without evidence should be marked as drafts until verified.
