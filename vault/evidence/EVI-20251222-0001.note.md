# Observation: Evidence-First Documentation

Date: 2025-12-22
Context: Setting up a knowledge management system

## Observation

When building a knowledge base, starting with raw evidence before making claims leads to:
1. More accurate documentation
2. Easier verification and auditing
3. Clearer separation between facts and interpretations

## Key Insight

The "evidence-first" approach inverts the typical workflow:
- Traditional: Write claim → Find supporting evidence
- Evidence-first: Capture evidence → Derive claims from evidence

This prevents "claim drift" where documentation gradually detaches from reality.

## Related Concepts

- Append-only logs
- Immutable audit trails
- Source-of-truth patterns
