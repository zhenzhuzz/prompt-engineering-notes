# Evidence-Based Knowledge Management

> Building reliable knowledge systems requires grounding claims in evidence and maintaining immutable audit trails.

## Context

This synthesis demonstrates the vault workflow: Evidence → Cards → Know. It combines insights from two cards derived from the same evidence observation.

## Key Insights

### Preventing Claim Drift (CARD-20251222-0001)

Documentation often starts with what we want to say, then finds supporting evidence afterward. This leads to "claim drift" where statements gradually detach from reality.

The evidence-first approach inverts this: capture observations first, then derive claims. This keeps documentation grounded.

### Enabling Verification (CARD-20251222-0002)

When evidence is immutable (append-only), every claim can be traced back to its source. This creates an audit trail that enables:
- Verification by others
- Historical review
- Trust in the knowledge base

## Connections

Both cards share a common theme: **reliability through constraints**. By constraining how we capture (evidence-first) and store (immutable) knowledge, we gain reliability and trust.

## Application

When adding to this vault:
1. Capture evidence before writing claims
2. Never modify existing evidence — only add new evidence or annotations
3. Reference evidence IDs in every card
4. Use Know docs only for synthesis, not new claims
